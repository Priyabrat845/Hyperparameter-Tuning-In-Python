# Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search vs Random Search
Hyperparameter tuningf is one of the most important parts of machine Learning pipelines. A wrong choice of the hyperparametersâ€™ values may lead to wrong results and a model with poor performance.

## Problem Statement
In this project I have discussed:
* Various ways to do the hyperparameter tuning in Machine Learning.
* The basic differnce between the Grid Search & Random Search.
* When to chose which hyperparameter tuning technique.
